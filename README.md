# wt_mm

WT_mm.xlsx contains a table where after each game I increase the cell according to what br I played and how much I got uptiered.

there is also a [google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ilx7BZjyRvm6xdBqbZDC2-T9_CW7Mr-zXG2tV3mw2yQ/edit?gid=1249862299#gid=1249862299) version, however it will become outdated from time to time if I forget to update it, maybe one day I will add a some python+github workflow to automate it


it contains rows for each br in the game and 4 collumns for for full downtier, partial downtier (+0.3), partial uptier (+0.7), and full uptier, its also divided into 3 sub tables for the time of the day and for arcade and realistic, all games are ground only. if I play on a machine without MS Excel I write my games into a .txt file for each date, these are deleted once transefered into the table



as of May 5th 2025
best br's 7.3 and 8.7
worst 6.7 and 8.0 (and <=3.0)



if you want to do your own stats, delete the contents of (ONLY!) the GAB and GRB morning, day and evening tables
