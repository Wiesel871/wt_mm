# wt_mm

WT_mm.xlsx contains a table where after each game I increase the cell according to what br I played and how much I got uptiered.



it contains rows for each br in the game and 4 collumns for for full downtier, partial downtier (+0.3), partial uptier (+0.7), and full uptier, its also divided into 3 sub tables for the time of the day and for arcade and realistic, all games are ground only. if I play on a machine without MS Excel I write my games into a .txt file for each date, these are deleted once transefered into the table



as of May 5th 2025
best br's 7.3 and 8.7
